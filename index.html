        bPROJECT PROPOSAL DESCRIPTIONbbrbr
          The system will be a centralized and structured method of maintaining 
          data, enabling simple information retrieval, reporting, and analysis which can contribute 
          to the overall improvement of decision-making as well as the tracking and monitoring of 
          the gasoline consumption of vehicles under the jurisdiction of the Rizal government. This 
          approach will also overcome the existing challenges of paper-based systems with poor 
          data organization, absence of accurate information, and restricted accountability and 
          transparency.
